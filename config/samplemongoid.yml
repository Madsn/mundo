  # many sessions as you like, but you must have at least 1 named
  # 'default'.
  sessions:
    # Define the default session.
    default:
      # A session can have any number of hosts. Usually 1 for a single
      # server setup, and at least 3 for a replica set. Hosts must be
      # an array of host:port pairs. This session is single server.
      hosts:
        - troup.mongohq.com:10074
      # Define the default database name.
      database: DB_NAME_HERE
      # Since this database points at a session connected to MongoHQ, we must
      # provide the authentication details.
      username: USER_NAME_HERE
      password: PASSWORD_HERE
    # This defines a secondary session at a replica set.
